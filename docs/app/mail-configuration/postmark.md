## Configuring Postmark

First off, make sure you have created an account with [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com). 

## Configuring Postmark

At Postmark you must [configure a new webhook](https://postmarkapp.com/support/article/1067-how-do-i-enable-delivery-webhooks).

The webhook should be sent to `https://<your-domain>/postmark-feedback`

You should add a custom header named `mailcoach-signature`, and you can choose a value that you should keep secret. You must turn on the `Open`, `Bounce`, `Spam Complaint` and `Link Click`.

On the settings screen in Postmark, you should also enable open and link tracking.

## Configuring Mailcoach

On the Mail configuration settings screen in Mailcoach, you'll have to have to fill in these settings.

- Mails per second: to not overwhelm Postmark with mail requests, send this to a sensible value. In many cases `10` will be sufficient
- Server token: you can get the right value on the [Postmark account details screen](https://account.postmarkapp.com/account/edit)
- Signing secret: this should be set to the value you specified for the `mailcoach-signature` header.
- Message stream (optional): the [Postmark Broadcast](https://postmarkapp.com/message-streams) message stream
